/**
 * 8.31 (Geometry: intersecting point) Write a method that returns the
 * intersecting point of two lines. The intersecting point of the two
 * lines can be found by using the formula shown in Programming
 * Exercise 3.25. Assume that (x1, y1) and (x2, y2) are the two points on
 * line 1 and (x3, y3) and (x4, y4) are on line 2............
 * The points are stored in a 4-by-2 two-dimensional array points with
 * (points[0][0], points[0][1]) for (x1, y1). The method returns the
 * intersecting point or null if the two lines are parallel. Write a
 * program that prompts the user to enter four points and displays the
 * intersecting point.
